#Zotero (Phil) - 15 minutes (not more than 20)

Intro: what is zotero and why is it good? In what ways does it save you labor?

    - Drag and drop sources like playlists in a music library; useful if you
        work in one field a lot like I do
    - Avoid messy syntax; export to clipboard or citation management file

Demo adding sources to zotero: use demo topic (Comparing the view of Robert
Moses and Jane Jacobs in contemporary urban design for my class; for Buck's?)

    - Use 2 articles, 1 magazine article, 2 books (or something)
    - Use at least one CLIO source to show that the data is all messy; demo
        cleaning data
    - Use at least one JSTOR source to show that some databases start out with
        considerably cleaner data
    - If you already have a book you can just search for it on Amazon, CLIO, or
        Google Books; just make sure you have the right edition so the page
        numbers are right

EXERCISE: Now, pull up the list of sources you have right now. Using some
combination of CLIO, JSTOR, Amazon, Google etc., find those files online and
import them into Zotero. We'll be floating around to help.

# Search engine resources 

[Both finding different search engines

Clio, library portals, databases

Write description of how to use each database

start with research guides to help them find databases

Need 14 databases to assign to students] Buck, want to take this since I'm
doing Zotero? (i.e. the stuff in brackets

each student uses one and jots down a few sentences about how it works and what
kind of sources; for homework

Demo factioning (use to transition) [Phil]

#Finding a book - 20 minutes [Buck]

Use the catalog search and factioning to find a book that will be useful to
your research.

look around the stacks for related titles, write down x number of titles; come
back
