##Course Description

University Writing is designed to help undergraduates read and write essays in
order to participate in the academic conversations that form our intellectual
community. We will give special attention to the practices of close reading,
rhetorical analysis, research, collaboration, and substantive revision.
Students will learn that writing is a process of continual refinement of ideas
and their expression. Rather than approaching writing as an innate talent, this
course will teach writing as a unique, learned skill that can be practiced and
developed. Over the course of the semester, you will read and discuss texts
relating to sustainable development, complete regular informal reading and writing
exercises, write several longer essays, and prepare an editorial for a public
audience.

What exactly does "sustainable development" mean, though? We will explore many
different answers to this question along the way---even come up with some of
our own---but we can begin with a few persuasive definitions. The U.N.'s "Brundtland
Report" (1987) says it is "development which meets the needs of current generations 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs." Jeffrey A. McNeely of the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature says that SD "unites the ecological concepts of carrying capacity with
the economic concepts of growth and development" (qtd. in Guha and
Martinez-Alier, 48). Others, like Carolyn Merchant, see it as a catchall term
for movements that attempt to resolve the "contradiction" between production
and ecology---movements like sustainable agriculture and "bioregionalism"
(Merchant 211-22). These authors all define
sustainable development as a way of relating to our
environment that minimizes ecological destruction while still leaving room for
progress, although they differ in their emphasis and motivation.
Throughout the semester, we will confront texts addressing this issue
from a wide range of disciplines and with vastly different perspectives on concepts
as fundamental as nature, growth, and community.

The theme of the course may be environmental, but its main goal is to help you
develop as a reader and writer. You will learn from accomplished thinkers and
essayists addressing topics in SD from different disciplinary perspectives. Using the techniques you learn in studying these texts, you
will choose several of them to build on, emulate, or challenge in your own
essays. The course is organized into four units we call
"progressions." Each progression consists of a series of class activities and
reading and writing exercises that will prepare you to write a particular kind
of essay. In progression one, you will analyze the ideas and method of one text
to respond to the writer’s argument on its own terms. In
progression two, you will learn to enter into a conversation or debate
among multiple texts. In progression three, you will work with your classmates over
several class sessions to explore the sources and implications of a single
seed text . You will then write an individual research essay on a project that
has emerged out of these explorations. In progression four, you will apply the
skills you have been developing over the course of the semester to make an
argument to a public.

Note: Your syllabus is a reference document to be frequently consulted. In it
you will find course policies, all major due dates, and a schedule of readings.
**You are responsible for every assignment on the syllabus, whether or not it
is mentioned in class.**
This syllabus is also available on the Courseworks site
[http://courseworks.columbia.edu](http://courseworks.columbia.edu).

#Requirements

* Complete four revised essays ranging from 750-3000 words, each accompanied by
at least one draft. Students must submit all four final essays in order to pass the class.
* Attend and participate in all classes and conferences.
* Complete reading and writing exercises as assigned.
* Submit all of your writing assignments on Courseworks.

#Assignments

You will do at least three types of writing in this course: exercises,
responses, drafts,
and final essays. These assignments will connect with one another in a
developmental sequence called a progression.

* **Exercises**: (250-750 words) Exercises will help you develop skills and ideas as
you work toward your essay draft.

* **Responses**: (250-500 words) Responses require you to write one to two
pages in which you pick one aspect of the text that especially interests you to
discuss. This does not require a full argument (and certainly no research), but
your discussion should be organized, written in complete sentences and
structured paragraphs, and have a
clear topic. The last thing a response should be is an elaboration of whether you liked or did
not like a text.

* **Drafts**: You will write one or more drafts prior to submitting a
final version of your essay for a progression. The stronger the draft at any
stage of composing, the more useful it (and the feedback you receive on it)
will be to your final essay.

* **Final Essays**: (must have a title, word count, and a works cited
page) A final essay is the most public kind of writing you will produce for
this course. Your essay should aim to persuade astute, interested readers who
are unfamiliar with the texts you engage; you need to convince them of why your
argument is significant.

#Weekly Article Share

Every Monday you will also be asked to pick one article, event, or news item
relating to the environment or sustainable development. You must post a link to
the article, your name, and a
1-3 sentence summary of the article's argument. This is informal, but important: together
we will build a repository of pieces that can be used to spur possible essay
topics later, either as exhibits or research topics. Perhaps more important, it will also help you draw connections
between what we discuss in class and what is happening in the rest of the
world.

#Required Texts

The syllabus, course description, requirements, readings, assignments, and
links to resources are available [on
CourseWorks](https://courseworks.columbia.edu/).

Additional readings will be assigned from The Morningside Review,
[morningsidereview.org](http://morningsidereview.org), which is the journal of selected essays from Columbia’s
Undergraduate Writing Program.

An up-to-date style manual for current MLA citation formatting conventions.
You are strongly encouraged to purchase a copy for your reference.

Here are links to two online versions:

As a student at Columbia, you can download bibliographic software to your PC or
Mac (not yet tablets or phones) that will archive and organize your textual
references and generate formatted citations in many formats. You will learn to
use one, Zotero, during the research progression, but you are free to use
another if you want to. You can download
one of those programs from CUIT:

#Course Policies

##Attendance

The discussion and workshop elements that are at the center of this course
cannot be made up, so attendance is vital. 

In accordance with Columbia University regulations, there will be distinctions
made between excused absences and unexcused absences. Excused absences include
those due to religious observance, athletic commitments (e.g. away games),
and illness, and they will not incur a grade penalty if proper documentation
is submitted correctly. In the first two weeks of class, students will also
not be penalized if they have been attending a different section of University
Writing and elect to change their section. Please see the specific
requirements below for how you should document absences you wish to be excused. 

##Documentation for excused absences

**Religious observance**: By the fourth class session, send an email to your
instructor---copied to your academic advisor---in which you outline all of the
dates you will be absent for the semester. Create a plan with your instructor
to make up work or reschedule deadlines.

**Athletic commitments**: Only participation in athletic contests will count as
excused absences; practice sessions do not. Prior to any absence, you must
submit to your instructor a completed and signed “Columbia University
Intercollegiate Athletics Academic Absence Notification Form.” 

Here is a link to the form:
[http://www.college.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/intercollegiate_athletic_academic_absence_notification_form.pdf](http://www.college.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/intercollegiate_athletic_academic_absence_notification_form.pdf)

**Illness**: A signed doctor’s note is required to excuse an absence. You should
bring the note to class on the day you are able to return. It is also
advisable---if you are able---to contact your instructor by email in order to alert
him or her that you will be unable to attend class.

**Section changes**: If you change your section of University Writing in the first
two weeks of class, you must provide your new instructor a completed and signed
“University Writing Attendance Confirmation” form. Please see Mr. John Stobo in
the Undergraduate Writing Program office, 310 Philosophy Hall, for a copy of
the form.

All other absences, including those due to late registration, are considered
unexcused. Unexcused absences will be penalized according to the chart below.
Please also note the Lateness policy in the next section to understand how
latenesses count towards your total number of absences. 

More than six unexcused absences will result in an automatic F course grade.

##Unexcused Absence Penalties

- 1-3 - You may incur 1/3 of a letter on the final grade for the progression per absence.
- 4 - 1/3 of a letter, course grade
- 5 - full letter, course grade
- 6 - 2 full letters, course grade
- 7 - F or UW, course grade

##Lateness

Lateness is disruptive to the entire class. If you arrive once class is
underway or depart before the class session has ended, you will be marked as
late. Two latenesses count as one absence in calculating your final course
grade. 

##Conferences and Office Hours

You will have at least two 20-30 minute conferences with me during the
semester, although I may require more. These conferences give you the
opportunity to discuss your ideas, to work through your drafts, to prepare for
presentations, or to revise your essays. You are welcome to come and see me in
office hours or by appointment to discuss any aspect of the course. 

##Assessment and Response

All of the writing you submit on time for this class will receive some sort of
written or recorded response from me and/or your classmates. While writing
exercises and preliminary drafts will not receive grades, they will be
important for your development as a writer and thinker, and you are expected to
complete them all. 

During the first three progressions, I will write marginal comments and typed
end-comments to one preliminary draft as well as your final draft. For your
final progression, you will receive end-comments on your final draft that
respond to the essay as well as your development over the course of the
semester. 

My comments are designed to help you assess your draft and prioritize goals for
the next stage of your writing. Just as important, my comments will offer you
practical strategies designed to further your ongoing development as a writer.
If you have any questions about my comments, please make an appointment with me
to review them.

#Grading

Each final essay for the progression will receive a letter grade from A 
to F. Your final course grade will be computed on the 4.0 scale. 
 
Each letter grade signifies the following:

“A” essays not only fulfill the goals of the progression, but push beyond those
goals in surprising ways. This is more likely to be possible when the writer
has found something compelling to write about and has taken great care to
attend to his or her language and form. A essays reflect excellence and
artistry. 

“B” essays come in two basic varieties: the “solid B” and the “striving B.”
The solid B is a good, competent paper. The striving B may excel in certain
areas, but it is sufficiently uneven to preclude it from receiving an A. B
essays reflect superior understanding of the progression’s goals.

“C” essays reflect struggle in fulfilling the progression’s goals. This kind
of essay may show a fair amount of work, but it does not come together well
enough to be a competent paper.

“D” essays may appear to have been hastily written, incomplete, or thrown
together.

“F” essays fail to meet the minimum level of expectations for the progression.

##Late and Missed Assignments, Drafts, and Final Essays

I will not accept any late exercises, and I will not give extensions for
problems such as computer and printer crashes, conflicts with other
course assignments or extracurricular activities, oversleeping or other
personal difficulties. Technical problems happen, so be prepared: back up all
your documents. Many students use free services like Dropbox, and I am happy to
recommend other methods. If your essay draft is late, I will respond to it if I
can, but I will not extend your revision time, making it much harder for you to
do well on the essay.

If you do not hand in a preliminary draft at least 48 hours to the deadline for
the final draft, your final essay grade will be lowered by one whole grade
(e.g. from a B to a C). Your grade on the final essay will be lowered by 1/3
(e.g. from a B- to a C+) beginning the minute after the deadline. The grade
will continue to go down by a third every 24 hours until the essay is
submitted. All work must be submitted to Courseworks by the deadline in order
to be considered on time. **Failure to submit the final draft of any essay by
the end of the semester will result in an automatic failure for the course.** 

##Final Grades

Your course work for the semester will be weighted as follows:

Progression 1:
One-text essay (Critical Response) (1500-1800 words) . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . .15%

Progression 2:
Conversation Essay (1800-2100 words) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . .25%

Progression 3:
Research Essay (2500-3000 words) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . .35%

Progression 4:
Editorial Essay (750-1000). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . .20%

TOTAL: 95%
EXTRA: 5%

(The "extra" percentage will be added to the essay on which you get the best
grade. If you don't do as well as you'd like on an essay, this percentage will
give you a chance to make up for it elsewhere.)


#Radical Revision

One of the fundamental principles of this course is that writing and reading
are recursive, iterative processes, which benefit from the input of others.
Therefore, I will give you the opportunity to revise one of your first two
essays once they have been commented on and graded, for an entirely new grade.
**Only essays that receive a grade of C- or lower are eligible for radical
revision; you cannot use this option to "top up" your grade, i.e., to turn a B-
into a B**. All
radically revised essays must be accompanied by a cover letter that describes
the significant difference between the previously assessed version and the new
one. I may require that you see me in conference before you submit a revised
essay. I would strongly encourage you to bring any essay you would wish to
have reconsidered under this policy to the Writing Center to help you gauge how
much your radically revised draft has changed from your previous one.

#ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

University Writing will provide you with strategies for working ethically and
accurately with the texts you engage and fulfilling the Columbia Undergraduate
Honor Code
[http://www.college.columbia.edu/ccschonorcode](http://www.college.columbia.edu/ccschonorcode). We will discuss
source use practices that prevent plagiarism, a serious academic offense that
runs counter to our academic community’s core values of honesty and respect for
others. Here is a partial list from the Columbia University Undergraduate Guide
to Academic Integrity
[https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity](https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity) of some of the
forms plagiarism can take:

* “Verbatim copying without acknowledgement – copying a whole paragraph or larger
sections; in effect, claiming that the writing is your own.”
* “Copying select phrases without acknowledgement – using your own words to pad
the selectively copied words of others.”
* “Paraphrasing text without acknowledgement – rewriting text in your own words,
but using the idea or argument as your own.”
* “Using data gathered by another, claiming it as your own – even if you submit
an analysis of the data that is yours alone.”

Final drafts that contain plagiarism will receive a zero, may result in failure
of the course, and the case will be reported to the director of the
Undergraduate Writing Program and the Office of Judicial Affairs and Community
Standards [http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/judicialaffairs/index.php].
That office initiates the dean’s discipline process and determines whether to
apply sanctions, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university.
 
#The Writing Center

I encourage you to visit the Writing Center
[www.college.columbia.edu/core/uwp/writing-center], where you can receive free
individual consultations on your writing at any stage in the writing process,
including brainstorming. Writing consultants work with all members of the
Columbia community on any academic or nonacademic writing. You can make an
appointment and view drop in hours on their website. 

#Other Support Services: Accessibility and Wellness

##Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Columbia University provides students who register with the Office of
Disability Services (ODS)
[http://www.health.columbia.edu/ods/news/ds-programs.html](http://www.health.columbia.edu/ods/news/ds-programs.html) with a range of
support options and will provide you with a letter stating the accommodations
to which you are entitled, without disclosing any other information about you.
If you know or believe you have a disability of some kind, please consult with
Disability Services and your advising dean as soon as possible; University
Writing instructors need official documentation from the ODS in order to
provide accommodations, and we cannot make retroactive accommodations.

##Counseling and Psychological Services

The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)
[http://www.health.columbia.edu/cps/index.html](http://www.health.columbia.edu/cps/index.html) provides many kinds of support
for student wellness and academic success.
